# Automatic Speech Recognition

In this project, we use [Nvidia Riva](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai-data-science/products/riva/) to implement ASR functionality, which can perform real-time audio transcription.


First, please refer to [this document](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Local_Voice_Chatbot/#install-riva-server) to install Nvidia Riva Server.

Then run the following script to start Riva microservice:

``` shell
python3 app.py  # microservice/ASR/app.py
```
